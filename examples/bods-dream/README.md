A lone Scout class ship must fend off an invasion during peacetime. The enemy attacks but war has not been declared.

It's going to take X amount of time (30-60 minutes) to get authorization from TSN HQ to fire on the enemy.

But the sector is full of monsters. The scout ship can use probes, tags, and especially beacons to make the sharks, piranhas, and bugs do the fighting for them.

If the players lock weapons on any enemy ship they instantly lose.

This script needs a lot of repetitive code: checking every enemy ship to see if the players have weapons lock.

To give Comms something to do, the script should also check every enemy ship to see if it has surrendered. If it has, the script should increase the surrendered ship's speed so it can leave the map without being eaten by whatever monster was attacking it.

And of course the sector should have a lot of unarmed friendly bases that must be defended.

The friendly bases and friendly ships should all be unarmed (science bases, luxury liners, etc.)
